# dejaverse
AI memory and context engine

Dejaverse is an innovative AI memory and context engine designed to enhance user experiences by understanding and maintaining personal context. Our system learns each user's working style, preferences, and knowledge, predicting needed information and generating smart documentation with visual aids.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Personal Context Understanding**: Learns your working style and builds semantic memory of your knowledge
- **Smart Documentation AI**: Auto-generates documentation from code or conversations with visual explanations
- **Context-Switching AI**: Maintains conversation threads across different applications
- **Privacy-First Design**: Uses federated learning and homomorphic encryption to ensure user data security

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- Python-based architecture
- Fine-tuned large language models for understanding user context
- Embedding models for mapping knowledge relationships
- Vision models for creating visual documentation
- Reinforcement learning for personalization based on user feedback

## 🔒 Privacy Approach

Unlike typical LLM wrappers, De'ja focuses on privacy using advanced techniques:
- Federated learning: Models train on local data without sharing it
- Homomorphic encryption: Processing encrypted data for enhanced security
- Continuous personalized learning without compromising data security

## 🚀 Project Status

Dejaverse is currently in early development. We're building our core engine and looking for contributors who are passionate about AI personalization and privacy.
